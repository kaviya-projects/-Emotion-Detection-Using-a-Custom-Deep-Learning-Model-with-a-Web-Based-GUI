# -Emotion-Detection-Using-a-Custom-Deep-Learning-Model-with-a-Web-Based-GUI
Developed a custom deep learning model for emotion detection from facial images, built from scratch without relying on pretrained models. The project followed a structured guide, detailing steps like data preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation) and designing the CNN architecture with convolutional layers, max-pooling, and batch normalization for feature extraction. A web-based GUI was integrated, allowing users to upload images for real-time emotion detection via the trained model. The guide served as a comprehensive framework for constructing and fine-tuning the model from the ground up, ensuring a thorough understanding of the entire deep learning and web development process.
