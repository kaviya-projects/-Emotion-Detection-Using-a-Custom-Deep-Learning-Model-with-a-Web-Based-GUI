# 😊 Emotion Detection Using Custom Deep Learning Model

A full-featured desktop application for real-time **emotion detection** using facial expressions. This project integrates a custom-trained CNN model, real-time webcam inference, and a web-based GUI built using **Tkinter** and **OpenCV**.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Detect emotions from webcam in real-time
- ✅ Upload image and predict emotion
- ✅ Beautiful and modern GUI (Tkinter)
- ✅ Highlights detected faces with labels
- ✅ Uses MTCNN for accurate face detection
- ✅ Built without pretrained emotion models — fully custom trained
